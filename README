Hi!

This project depends on ROS and the ardrone_brown package

This is a ROS package designed to accept data from the AR Drone and send commands to drone_teleop to send Twist messages to the drone.

Empty Messages are sent to initiate takeoff, landing, and reset

Twist Messages, containing linear and angular velocities in the x, y, z axes, are sent to cmd_vel
The recommended values for theres commands is a magnitude of under 1.
